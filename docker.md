# [Docker]

- Official tutorial:
    - https://docs.docker.com/get-started/
    - relative code:
        /Users/dyt/docker/docker101tutorial/app/app/Dockerfile
- container: 
  - is a sandboxed process on your machine that is isolated from all other processes on the host machine.
  - is a runnable instance of an image. You can create, start, stop, move, or delete a container using the DockerAPI or CLI.
  - can be run on local machines, virtual machines or deployed to the cloud.
  - is portable (can be run on any OS).
  - is isolated from other containers and runs its own software, binaries, and configurations.
- image:
  - When running a container, it uses an isolated filesystem. This custom filesystem is provided by a container image. 
  - Since the image contains the containerâ€™s filesystem, it must contain everything needed to run an application - all dependencies, configurations, scripts, binaries, etc. The image also contains other configuration for the container, such as environment variables, a default command to run, and other metadata.
- Dockerfile: 
  - is simply a text-based script of instructions that is used to create a container image. 
- build an  image
  - build the container image using the docker build command.

    ```$ docker build -t getting-started .``` (must have Dockerfile created.) This command used the Dockerfile to build a new container image.

- Run an App Container
  
    Now that we have an image, let's run the application! To do so, we will use the docker run command.

    Start your container using the docker run command and specify the name of the image we just created:

    ```docker run -dp 3000:3000 getting-started```

- Stop and remove a container
    - docker ps
    - docker stop <the-container-id>
    - docker rm <the-container-id> 
    - every time we make a change in  our code we need to rebuild and start a new container (later will do persistence to avoid this)
